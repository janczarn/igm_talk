# Introduction to web development

This repository contains the code for the four examples shown in the IGM talk.
To run the code, first download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
I would opt for the most recent LTS version. It can also be downloaded using
Homebrew:

```
brew install node
```

In each directory run:

```
npm install
```

This will download the packages specified in the package-lock.json file of each
project into its node_modules directory.

See the package.json file of each project to see the scripts that can be run.
Some projects require building before they can be run.
